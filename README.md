## Overview

This is my learning project for practicing with next.js app router, client and server components, server actions and caching system.

#### Stack:

- Next.js
- React
- Docker (used for db)
- Postresql
- Prisma

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
